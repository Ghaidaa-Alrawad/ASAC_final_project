# ASAC_final_project (BookShelf)
The Bookshelf Library Project website is a testament to my work on the ASAC fall training with the instructor Boshra Jaber. 
Under Boshra's expert guidance, I was able to build this website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and REST API to bring the book's Picture, Name, and the Published Date.

## Features
- Log in page for authentication
- Display book information: picture of the book, title, and published date
- There is a slider that will show you quotes from books
- Log out button in the nav bar, when the user is done with the website they can log out


 
## Contributions
This project was created as part of my ASAC field training, and it was a front-end course, well since it's a front-end course I've used the local storage that javascript provides and put some random users manually; to be able to use the log-ing system that I provide in my BookShelf website. 
Contributions are welcome, but please make sure to open an issue or submit a pull request first.
